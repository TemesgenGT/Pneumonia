# Pneumonia Detection using Transfer Learning 
Pneumonia is lung diseases. The disease is prevalent in children below the age of five and categorized under the top few diseases that kill children. Pneumonia is a curable disease if it is treated at the early stage otherwise, chance to recover is slim especially, when the victim is informed incorrectly. This project aimed to improve the image classification for pneumonia postive images to minimize the severity as result of false negative information.
