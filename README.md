# Pneumonia Detection using Transfer Learning 
Pneumonia accounts for 15% of all deaths of children under 5 years old, killing 808,694 children in 2017.  Being better able to predict pneumonia quickly and accurately and at a low cost could have a large impact on healthcare related to pneumonia and on patient outcomes. In this project, I seek to use transfer learning to build a model that can accurately diagnose pneumonia based on chest X-rays.
