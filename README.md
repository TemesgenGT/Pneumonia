# Pneumonia Detection Transfer Learning
Pneumonia is a diseases attack lung. The disease is prevalent in children below the age of five and known as the top few diseases that kill children. Pneumonia is a curable disease if it is treated at an early stage, however, time is crucial for successful recovery otherwise, the chance to recover becomes slim especially, when the victim is informed incorrectly. The project designed to improve image identification score while minimizing the false negative rate.
